# Sample-Throw-Mechanics
Sample project representing interacting with a rigid body in constrained space


Keeping rigid body in bounds is handled by a combinantion of fixed joints and moving an external controller rigid body. 
That way we can mimic the behaviour of actually holding and object while still keeping it in bounds of our scene. There is 
also a special editor class that centers any die face based on the distance to the nearest triangle.
